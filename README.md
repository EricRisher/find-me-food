# find-me-food
The Find me food application was designed to help you find 
any cuisine you are interested in as well as provide
you with the reviews. Once you put in your preferred location along 
with the desired cuisine the map will show you all the 
nearby food places depending on the location entereted. 
The application will also show you the yelp
reviews as you click on the place you've chosen. 
The application is using google maps api as well as the
yelp api to help you obtain all the information you are
looking for with one click instead of using different apps 
to find everything.
